Hello everyone! AccessTransit is a civic tech initiative by Eileen Rodriguez, Kelly Xiong Chen, and Veshona Shell, developed under the team name VKEbility as part of the Marcy Lab School. Our mission is to create a full-stack application that provides real-time transit accessibility updates and MTA signage translations to empower all riders—regardless of mobility, language, or ability—to navigate New York City's public transportation system with confidence and ease.

Here is our [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OwRAlXu_ii2P4uzjjbdl-2FIa3PcWFiEcKzQgzu6jZE/edit?usp=sharing). The proposal is a technical document pitch that succinctly lays out the MVP we're shooting for and any stretch goals. The project overview and deliverable milestone requirements are [here](https://github.com/VKEbility/.github). By leveraging crowdsourced data, AccessTransit aims to fill the gaps in the MTA's accessibility features, providing users with accurate information on elevator and escalator status, as well as multilingual sign translations for a more inclusive commuting experience.
